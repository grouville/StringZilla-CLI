//! Fuzzy substring search over StringZilla's collection kernels, where `sz-find` matches literally.
//!
//! A query is expanded into every string within `--max-distance` edits of it, and those variants
//! are matched exactly by one Aho-Corasick automaton. The edit model therefore lives in the
//! vocabulary and its BM25 weights rather than in a substitution matrix, so `--max-distance` is an
//! edit budget in every mode and digits never share a scoring class with each other.
//!
//! `--cost keyboard` draws substitutions and insertions from physically adjacent keys instead of
//! the whole alphabet, which is what keeps a two-edit ball affordable.
//!
//! Every query's variants are pooled into one dictionary, so the corpus is walked once however many
//! `--pattern` flags are given. BM25 scores that walk: a strictly positive weight per variant makes
//! a positive score mean "matched", and `find` runs afterwards, over survivors only, when
//! spans are actually asked for.
//!
//! Exit: 0 matched something, 1 matched nothing, 2 could not run.
