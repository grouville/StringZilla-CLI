//! SHA256 checksums for many files at once, standing in for `sha256sum`.
//!
//! Each SHA256 block feeds the next, so one file cannot be hashed faster by adding cores or
//! widening a register. A *batch* of files can: AVX-512 advances sixteen independent states per
//! instruction, which measures 2.50 GB/s per core against 1.33 GB/s for a single stream.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! Two widths, tuned apart. A worker keeps `io_width` files reading at once — wider than the
//! sixteen lanes a call advances — and hashes whichever sixteen have a chunk in hand, taking them
//! off a ready queue rather than waiting on any named file. A file that is slow to read costs only
//! itself. Eight live lanes hash at 1.33 GB/s against sixteen lanes' 2.50, so the extra IO width
//! is what keeps groups full and the cliff out of reach until the queue itself runs dry.
//!
//! ```text
//! slots  A B C D E F G H ...   io_width files, all reading
//!        │ │   │   │   │
//!        ▼ ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼       whichever have a chunk in hand
//!        ready queue ──▶ take 16 ──▶ one multistate step ──▶ release
//! ```
//!
//! # Reading
//!
//! A queue depth of one reads at 0.6 GB/s where a depth of sixteen reads at 8-9 GB/s, so the
//! kernel interface, not the hash, is what a checksummer is limited by. Three fleets sit behind
//! one trait, probed at startup: `io_uring` with `O_DIRECT`, Linux AIO with `O_DIRECT` where the
//! ring is forbidden, and blocking reads everywhere else. The last is the portable floor and the
//! reference the other two are checked against. Nothing in that trait mentions hashing, so a
//! cipher over the same machinery reuses it whole.
//!
//! # Widths and Counts
//!
//! One rule, so a reader never has to work out which kind of number they are holding: a byte
//! count that describes a **file** is `u64`, because a file may be larger than a 32-bit address
//! space and `Metadata::len` reports `u64` on every platform; a byte count that describes
//! **memory** is `usize`, because it is bounded by an allocation this process made; and an
//! **index** — into the input list, the slots, the lanes — is `usize`.
//!
//! Exit: 0 hashed a file, or under `--check` every line verified; 1 nothing to hash, a checksum
//! did not match, or `--strict` met a line that is not a checksum line; 2 could not run, which
//! under `--check` includes a manifest holding no checksum lines at all.
