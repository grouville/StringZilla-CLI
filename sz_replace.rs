//! Literal substring replacement, standing in for `sed s///g` without the regex.
//!
//! The pattern is either a substring or a line name, and both can be guarded. `--expect-hash`
//! refuses the edit unless the input still hashes to what the caller read, and `--occurrences one`
//! refuses unless the pattern picks out exactly one place. Both are settled before any destination
//! is opened, which is why a run that refuses has written nothing at all.
//!
//! Case folding runs through StringZilla's full-Unicode `utf8_uncased_search`, so a match can be
//! wider or narrower than the pattern — `ß` folds to `ss`, `İ` to `i` — and the cursor advances by
//! the matched length rather than the pattern's.
//!
//! Exit: 0 produced a stream, 1 produced none, 2 could not run, 3 the file or the name
//! moved and the caller should read again. `--quiet` changes what is printed, never what is
//! reported.
